# Small Docker Compose Example

This is just a small example showing how docker compose may be used for testing an application.
In this example we 
* Start a mysql container.
* Prepare some test data.
* Run a container that queries and modifies this data. This part acts as a placeholder for some real application one might want to test.
* Finally shut down the mysql container which completes the run.
